## **VRmod for Native Linux Garry's Mod x64 build - AIO Package**

**Optimization problem:**

VRmod and its components, such as hand physics and melee attacks, are maintained by different authors. In some cases, they conflict with each other, and some addons are abandoned or broken.

Apart from that there were rendering problems on Linux (Chromium x64) build and image was not optimized for Quest 2/3.

**Additional info about this version of VRmod:**

* Integrated collision physics, melee, (fixed) manual pickup
* Developed and tested with Quest 2/Quest 3 on Linux OS (kUbuntu 24.04)
* Fixed rendering issues on Linux native build
* Tailored for Quest 3 to avoid fish eye effect and distorted image when tilting head.
* In theory should work on Windows  (not tested)

**Known issues:**

* Might Need to install and launch original VRmod once

**Installation:**

Make sure you can run gmod x64 on your system. On Native Linux version itâ€™s required to run [GModCEFCodecFix](https://github.com/solsticegamestudios/GModCEFCodecFix)

Either [download precompiled module](https://github.com/catoni0/vrmod-module-master/tree/main/install) for native build or complie your own.

Place vrmod folder in HOME/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/
