## **VRMod x64 Build ‚Äì All-In-One Package with Linux Support**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Optimization Issues

VRMod and its components‚Äîsuch as hand physics, melee attacks, and item interaction‚Äîare maintained by different authors. This often results in compatibility issues, broken features, or abandoned modules.

This build focuses on **optimization** by merging essential features from semi-official forks and third-party addons, with an emphasis on performance, cross-platform stability, and code de-duplication.
