Initially the goal was to make a VRmod to work on Linux + gmod 64. 

Pescorr's Semi- Offical Version didn't not start, so I integrated most or the changes that worked for me into the Catse's original version. 

Optimization problem:
VRmod and it's parts such as hand physics,melee attacks and such are maintained by different authors. In some cases like with physics mod and melee mod, both create exactly the same props to be used as collision detection, so ideally one must avoid such cases. 

The projects is reorganized and contains works of various authors:

Catse, original VRmod creator
Pescorr, semiofficial VRmod creator
Hugo, manual pickup (fixed it btw),simple hand physics and hl2 weapon replacer
Arctic for ArcVR

Might be more, contact me to be included
